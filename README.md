# Phase-Prediction-of-High-Entrop-Alloys
This project focuses on predicting the phase formation in High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) using machine learning. HEAs are multi-component metallic systems with exceptional mechanical and thermal properties. The goal is to build a predictive model that can determine alloy phases based on elemental and thermodynamic features.
